CateLytics: Review-Driven Categorization using Amazon Data
Project Overview
CateLytics is a Big Data project designed to categorize Amazon products based on insights derived from user reviews. The goal is to identify trends around customer-centric product categories by analyzing user reviews. This approach uncovers hidden product categories that may not align with conventional groupings, providing a more intuitive understanding of products through user feedback.

The project leverages Spark to perform data operations such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and transformations. By processing and analyzing large amounts of unstructured data, it helps customers find suitable products based on real user feedback and sentiment, rather than traditional product descriptions or ratings. Additionally, CateLytics aims to assist customers in making informed and ethical purchasing decisions using natural language queries through an integrated Chatbot.
